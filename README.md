Cub3D is a project from Ã‰cole 42 aimed at creating a 3D rendering engine using the raycasting technique, similar to the one used in early first-person shooter games like Wolfenstein 3D. The project uses the MinilibX graphics library to create windows, handle events, and manipulate images. The main steps include reading the map from a file, calculating rays to determine intersections with walls, applying textures, and implementing controls to allow the player to navigate through a 3D maze. The ultimate goal is to create a smooth and responsive gaming experience while optimizing performance.
